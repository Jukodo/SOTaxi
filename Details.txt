Communication:
	- ConTaxi -> CenTaxi: shared memory
	- CenTaxi -> ConTaxi (new passenger): shared memory
	- CenTaxi -> ConTaxi (assigned passenger): named pipes
	- CenTaxi -> ConTaxi (central shutdown): named pipes (?)
	- CenTaxi <-> ConPass: named pipes
	- CenTaxi <-> MapInfo: shared memory
	- Create a diagram that shows all communications (for report)

Open details:
	- Commands names
	- GUI details
	- Communication messages formats
	- Map structure details
	- Sync behaviours, which and where are necessary
	- Maybe other details

Requirements:
	- ConTaxi DLL which contains functionality to communicate with CenTaxi
	- Shared memory (ConTaxi -> CenTaxi (Check new passengers)) must follow the provider/consumer pattern, with a buffer of 5 positions
	- MapInfo must be clean, without stuttering (use double buffering)
	- MapInfo must have the following behaviour:
		- Mouse over a taxi: shows additional information, such as, license plate and passenger destination (if assigned)
		- Mouse click on a passenger: shows additional information, such as, destination and assigned taxi license plate (if assigned)
		- Menu and a dialog box to configure a theme, allowing the user to use images/icons for: free taxi, busy taxi, unassigned passenger, assigned passenger (this will be saved in Registry)
	- Do not do:
		- Global variables
		- Non use of Unicode
		- Bad structure of code
		- Bad use of header files

Provided DLL:
	- Must be used explicitly
	- Must register all sync and communication mechanisms
	- Must log in certain cases:
		- Taxi moves: log all details of the taxi
		- Communication between processes: log origin and destination, mechanism used, and the information passed
		- Taxi/Passenger is added/removed: log what has changed

Extra steps:
	- Taxi smart movement AI (10% of final grade)
	- Passenger awaiting time estimate (5% of final grade)

Attention:
	- Do not use pointers on shared memory
	- Plan data structures carefully
	- If using GIT, make sure it is private
	- All code must be known and ready to be vocally explained

Step 1:
	- All of CenTaxi/ConTaxi, except named pipes and communication of MapInfo
	- Deliver brief report about crucial points, data structures, all mechanisms used that weren't defined by the professor and a diagram with the sync and communication mechanisms... The report must also include a table listing every requirement (not) implemented
	- The CenTaxi/ConTaxi applications, must be provided in a way that they can be tested
